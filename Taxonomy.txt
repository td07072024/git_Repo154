The genus Meleagris was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae.[1] The genus name is from the Ancient Greek μελεαγρις, meleagris meaning "guineafowl".[2] The type species is the wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo).[3]

Turkeys are classed in the family Phasianidae (pheasants, partridges, francolins, junglefowl, grouse, and relatives thereof) in the taxonomic order Galliformes.[4] They are close relatives of the grouse and are classified alongside them in the tribe Tetraonini.
